//
//  FeatureTipManager.swift
//  Joodle
//
//  Drives non-blocking feature-discovery tooltips. Holds the persisted "seen"
//  set, the live frames of on-screen anchors, the active screen scopes, and the
//  single currently-active tip. Follows the `ChangelogManager.shared` singleton
//  convention.
//
//  Eligibility model (no version comparison needed):
//    • `.anchorVisible` tips show while their anchor is on screen AND unseen.
//    • `.scoped` tips show while their scope (a whole screen) is active AND
//      unseen — even before the target row renders. When the live anchor frame
//      is unavailable the bubble clamps to a screen edge (see `fallbackEdge`).
//    • Tapping a tip's target marks its whole feature seen (`markSeen` clears
//      every tip sharing the same `featureKey`).
//    • New installs are suppressed: `markAllCurrentTipsAsSeen()` is called once
//      on first onboarding completion, so fresh users — who already learned the
//      features via the onboarding tutorial — don't get tooltips. Existing,
//      already-onboarded users have these tips unseen, so newly-added tips
//      surface for them on update.
//    • Tips flagged `showsAfterOnboarding` are exempt from that permanent
//      suppression: on onboarding completion they're suppressed only for the
//      current session (in-memory, see `sessionSuppressedIDs`), so they stay
//      hidden the first time the user opens the app but surface from the second
//      launch onward — for features the onboarding tutorial doesn't cover.
