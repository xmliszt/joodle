This update introduces **Labs**, a space for exploring gentle, evolving ideas inside Joodle.

**🧪 Labs (Experimental Features)**

- Added a new **Labs** section for early, experimental features
- Labs features are optional and may evolve over time

**🌊 Passing Time — Water Backdrop**

- Shows an animated water level in the background that slowly drains throughout the day
- Water reacts naturally to the tilting of your device, giving time a subtle, physical presence

- Added a new tutorial item explaining how to access **Experimental Features** in Labs

**⚙️ Settings Improvements**

- Added **changelog tracking** inside Settings
- Introduced a **What’s New** section so you can easily see what’s changed

Thank you for exploring Joodle as it grows.  
Some ideas start small — quietly drifting — before becoming part of the everyday.
