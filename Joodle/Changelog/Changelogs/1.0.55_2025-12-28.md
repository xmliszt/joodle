Introducing **Labs**, a space for exploring ideas inside Joodle.

- Added a new **Labs** section for early, experimental features
- Added **Experimental Features** option under **Labs**
- Introduced the first experimental feature: **Passing Time Water Backdrop** which shows an animated water level in the background that slowly drains throughout the day. The water reacts naturally to the tilting of your device, giving time a subtle, physical presence

**📘 Onboarding & Guidance**

- Added a new tutorial item explaining how to access **Experimental Features**

**⚙️ Changelog Tracking**

- Added bottom sheet display for changelog when you upgdate Joodle to a new version.
- Added **What's New** in **Settings** under **Need Help?** section, so you can easily see what's new in Joodle.
