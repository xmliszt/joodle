//
//  AutoTraceButton.swift
//  Joodle
//
//  The standalone auto-trace control: a circular Liquid Glass button, sibling to
//  the canvas's other glass buttons (clear / undo / redo / confirm). A plain tap
//  traces the reference photo at the default detail; a long-press blooms a fan of
//  three detail levels you swipe through and release to pick.
//
//  The fan is three more glass circles that morph straight out of the source
//  button: on iOS 26 a shared `GlassEffectContainer` fuses them, so they stretch
//  apart like liquid and neck back together on collapse — the real thing, no
//  hand-drawn metaball. Older systems fall back to three circles that fade and
//  scale out of the source and back in. Letting go of a still hold leaves the
//  fan standing: tap a level to trace at it, or the source to dismiss.
//
//  The button rests in the bottom corner on the user's handedness side, so the
//  fan opens toward the screen interior — up-and-inward, away from the corner.
//  Dragging a press clear across to the opposite side flings the button to the
//  other corner (the host owns that position, so it can spring across).
